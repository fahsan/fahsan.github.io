Hi! I'm a computational biologist and laboratory manager at the [UCLA](https://medschool.ucla.edu) [Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine](https://http://pathology.ucla.edu), working in [Michael Teitell's](https://teitell-lab.dgsom.ucla.edu) laboratory. I manage and develop computational pipelines, leveraging next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to understand mechanisms of fundamental developmental biology, including transcriptional regulation of immune cell activation, RNA processing, mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunction, and biophysical nanotechnology development. My work integrates genomic data science and predictive modeling to answer key interdiscplinary questions between biology and engineering. I routinely collaborate with immunologists, cancer biologists, cellular biochemists, computer scientists, and bioengineers to investigate cellular development and dysfunction at a systems-level.
