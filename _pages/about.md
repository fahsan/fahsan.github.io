Welcome to my page! I am a sixth year doctoral student in the [Biological and Biomedical Sciences PhD Program](https://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/bbs/) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu) [Graduate School of Arts and Sciences](https://gsas.harvard.edu) and [Harvard Medical School](https://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/) [Division of Medical Sciences](https://www.hms.harvard.edu/dms/). I joined the [Alex Soukas](https://cgm.massgeneral.org/faculty/alexander-soukas/) group for [Aging, Obesity, and Diabetes Research](https://www.soukas.org) in the [Center for Genomic Medicine](https://cgm.massgeneral.org) at [Massachusetts General Hospital Research Institute](https://www.massgeneral.org/research) for my thesis work in 2020. Outside of the lab I am a curriculum director for the educational outreach program [HPREP](https://hprep.wordpress.com), faculty chat coordinator for the [Harvard GSAS Science Policy Group](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/sciencepolicy/home), and a member of [Harvard Science in the News - Science by the Pint](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/science-by-the-pint/). 

I was previously a computational biologist and laboratory manager at the [UCLA](https://medschool.ucla.edu) [Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine](https://http://pathology.ucla.edu), working in [Michael Teitell's](https://teitell-lab.dgsom.ucla.edu) laboratory, where I studied immunometabolism, metabolic cell fate, and mitonuclear balance. I developed computational pipelines and leveraged next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to better understand mechanisms of fundamental developmental biology, including transcriptional regulation of immune cell activation, RNA processing, mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunction, and biophysical nanotechnology development. My work integrated genomic data science and predictive modeling to answer key interdiscplinary questions between biology and engineering. I routinely collaborated with immunologists, cancer biologists, cellular biochemists, computer scientists, and bioengineers to investigate cellular development and dysfunction at a systems-level. 

I graduate from [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu) in 2015 with a Bachelor of Science degree in [Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics](https://www.mimg.ucla.edu). At UCLA, I was a lead for the [UCLA Synthetic Biology Undergraduate Research/iGEM Team](https://www.igematucla.com) and was a director for [CityLab at UCLA](https://twitter.com/citylabatucla?lang=en).
