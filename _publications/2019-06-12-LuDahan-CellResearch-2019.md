title: "Mitochondrial metabolism and glutamine are essential for mesoderm differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells."
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-06-12-LuDahan-CellResearch-2019
excerpt: 'Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) generate energy mainly by aerobic glycolysis, with glutamine oxidation in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle providing additional ATP required for survival. During the exit from pluripotency and initial differentiation into multiple germ lineage precursors, energy production shifts from mainly aerobic glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Until recently, consensus in the field was that as PSCs exit pluripotency, a metabolic switch from aerobic glycolysis to OXPHOS is required.'
